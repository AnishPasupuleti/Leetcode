## 🚀 About This Repository

Welcome to my **daily LeetCode grind repo** – a structured, topic-wise archive of solved problems with clear explanations and clean code.  
This isn't just practice — it's a **public record of learning, improving, and leveling up for real-world interviews**.  

Every solution in here:
- ✅ Uses Python  
- ✅ Follows clean coding practices  
- ✅ Includes a human explanation (not just code)  
- ✅ Is organized for easy lookup by topic and problem ID

---

## 📁 Folder Structure


Each folder represents a **topic**, and inside it are problems with:
- `solution.py` → clean Python solution  
- `explanation.md` → breakdown of logic, time/space complexity, and thought process

---

## 🎯 Goals

- 📅 **Daily commitment** to at least one problem  
- 📂 **Topic-based learning**: focus deeply on one type at a time  
- 📈 **Progress you can see**, not just submit  
- 🧠 **Become interview-ready** for top tech roles
